Typically when you sign up for a phone carrier, you're just getting service from one network. That's not the case with Google Fi (formerly Project Fi), which lets your phone actively switch between T-Mobile, Sprint and US Cellular. It's a big selling point for the service, and when you add in Wi-Fi calling and texting, it's quite the network juggling act.

After using Google Fi for some time, though, it turns out the regular switching between networks isn't all that confusing after all.

## What is Google Fi?

With a Google Fi plan, you'll get improved network coverage. Fi uses two carriers (T-Mobile - which has since bought Sprint - and US Cellular) and Wi-Fi hotspots if available to ensure you always have the most reliable connection wherever possible. You just need to use Fi with a smartphone that's either "designed" for Fi or "compatible" with Fi. This can be an unlocked Android, Pixel, or even an iPhone.

Beyond cellular and data coverage, Google Fi is all about streamlined billing. You pay one fee per month for unlimited talk and texting, plus a flat rate per gigabyte of data after that. There's also a level called "Bill Protection", which effectively caps your charges every month and therefore serves an unlimited plan. You can also do international data and calling with Fi, and there's no additional cost for data use or texting. 

## How does Google Fi work?

### Sign up for Fi

Those of you who already have a phone number from a different carrier service that you want to use must first switch carriers and port your phone number. Fortunately, you can sign up for Google Fi online in minutes, and it does a lot of the hard work for you. Some carriers do not allow you to take your number, but Google will check if you can transfer when you sign up. The transfer process usually only takes 15 minutes.

### Setting up your device

Next, Google Fi requires a special SIM card. You can either buy a new phone with this SIM card when you sign up for Fi, or Google will ship you a free SIM card to put in your existing phone and activate. To check whether you can have a phone that is "compatible" with Fi, use Google's checker tool, or see this full list of compatible phones. Most popular Android phones and iPhone models from 5S on up will work with Fi.

If you own a Google Pixel device, you're lucky, because you can get started right away. It has an integrated eSIM that works with Fi. With an eSIM, essentially, there is no need for a physical SIM card, which frees up your SIM slot so it can be used on another carrier's network if desired.
